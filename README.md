# supertest-jest-nodejs

testing is generally what pisses every developer off 
after getting problems on my main project I decided to implement a basic example on testing with jest and supertest to better identify my mistakes . 


this project tests if the user is entering a username and password in a POST request 


note that we have separated our server and app , that is an important detail in testing , you might have to discover that the hard way  .
